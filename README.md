### 🌈 About Me

Hey! I'm a 2nd-year B.Tech student juggling sem deadlines, debugging errors, and doodling in the margins of my notes 👀✏️  
Coding during the day, sketching at night – I'm all about **creativity + logic** 😉💻🎨

- ✍️ Passionate about: Web dev, design, and digital art
- 🌱 Learning: React, DSA, and how to draw hands (still hard lol)
- ☕ Powered by: Chai, memes, and late-night motivation
